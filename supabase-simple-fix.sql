-- Simple fix: Disable RLS for tables to allow registration
-- This is a quick fix for testing - you can re-enable RLS later with proper policies

-- Disable RLS on all tables for now
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.point_transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.redemption_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.rewards DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.milestones DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Ensure proper permissions are granted
GRANT ALL ON public.users TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.point_transactions TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.redemption_history TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.rewards TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.milestones TO authenticated, anon;
